Hi, I'm Martín 👋

Project Manager with 4 years leading software development teams in healthcare, sports tech, and Web3.
I'm not a developer by trade, but I stay close to the code — reviewing PRs, contributing to documentation, and making sure I understand what my teams build. Currently studying Computer Science at FIUBA to deepen that technical foundation.

**What I do:**

- Lead cross-functional teams (3-15 developers)
- Manage client relationships in English and Spanish
- Keep projects on track with Agile methodologies
- Onboard and mentor new developers

**Notable contribution:**

- Second-highest contributor to [LambdaClass's developer training curriculum](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambdaclass_hacking_learning_path)

📍 Buenos Aires, Argentina
